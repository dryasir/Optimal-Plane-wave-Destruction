C18     (This step was performed onboard the Pelican using SIOSEIS software)    C19 2:  Pre velocity analysis processing:                                       C20     Scaling and noise reduction (individual trace balance; F-K filter and   C21     automatic noise edit where needed); minimum phase spiking deconvolution C22     (single window design; 80 ms operator length)                           C23 3:  Velocity Analysis using velocity function from wells as initial guide.  C24 4:  Bandpass Filter, Normal Moveout and stack for quality control           C25 5:  Post Velocity Analysis Processing (Input from step #1):                 C26 6:  Noise edit: automatic noise burst removal, eliminate shots with         C27     unacceptable noise levels in area of interest (linear, high-amplitude,  C28     source noise from nearby survey); manual and automatic edit of noisy    C29     individual traces; "bottom" mute of noise below area of interest.       C30 7:  Derive average source wavelet (Oppenhein and Schafer, 1975):  Minimum   C31     phase, 256 ms wavelet, design window = 1s length starting at seafloor.  C32 8:  Calculate inverse filter to convert average wavelet to zero phase.      C33 9:  Apply Inverse Filter in shot domain                                     C34 10: True Relative Amplitude scaling: Shot balance (derive single scalar     C35     for each shot based on 2200ms window beginning at seafloor);            C36     T**2 amplitude recovery.                                                C37 11: Bandpass Filter (35-375 Hz Butterworth Filter), NMO, stack (1/N**.5     C38     amplitude compensation; N=number of live samples stacked)               C39 12: Stolt F-K Migration (Claerbout,1985; Deregowski,1990; Stolt,1978)       C40     Velocity Model = smoothed stacking velocities (51 CMPs, 100 ms)
